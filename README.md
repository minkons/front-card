Frontend Mentor - Blog preview card solution

This is my solution to the Blog preview card challenge from Frontend Mentor.
The goal was to build a responsive blog card using HTML and CSS.

While working on this project, I learned that font sizes can be adjusted for different screen sizes without using media queries.
